% visible, binary, stochastic pixels are connected to
% hidden, binary, stochastic feature detectors using symmetrically
% weighted connections. Learning is done with 1-step Contrastive Divergence.   
% The program assumes that the following variables are set:
% maxepoch  -- maximum number of epochs
% numhid    -- number of hidden units 
% batchdata -- the data that is divided into batches (numcases numdims numbatches)
% restart   -- set to 1 if learning starts from beginning 
% verbose   -- set to 1 if error statements are to be printed
