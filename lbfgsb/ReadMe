Compile it on linux/Mac by either running "make" in matlab (which runs make.m) 
or by running "make all" in bash (which uses Makefile).
(Compiling on Windows machines requires Intel Visual Fortran compiler 
and Visual Studio compiler.)  

Examples of usage: examplehs038.m

More details on the paramters are at parameters.txt.

There are two ways to invoke the lbfgsb solver:
1: use function pointer
[x, f, iter, numCall, flag] = lbfgsb(x0,lb,ub,@computeObjAndGrad,[],@genericcallback, param);

In this case, one must provide a function which 
returns both the function value and the gradient.


2: use string as function name.
[x, f, iter, numCall, flag] = lbfgsb(x0,lb,ub,'computeObjectiveHS038','computeGradientHS038',...
           [],'genericcallback', param);

In this case, one must provide two functions.  
One returns the function value and one returns the gradient.
